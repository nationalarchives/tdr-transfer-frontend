      TDR is run by the Digital Archiving department at The National Archives.
      It is designed to be used by as many people as possible.
      The text should be clear and simple to understand. You should be able to:

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-list--spaced">
      <li>zoom in up to 300% without problems</li>
      <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
      <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
      <li>
        use most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver</li>

    <p class="govuk-body">The website text has been made as simple to understand as possible and tested with real users.</p>
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How accessible this website is</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      In its current iteration, the vast majority of TDR fully meets Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA standards.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Parts of this website that are not fully accessible include:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-list--spaced">
      <li>some heading elements are not consistent</li>
      <li>some images do not have image descriptions</li>
      <li>some buttons are not correctly identified</li>
      <li>some error messages are not sufficient to identify or rectify errors</li>
      <li>some custom elements are inaccessible for assistive technologies</li>
    </ul>


    <p class="govuk-body">
      As part of ongoing development, design iterations incorporate a progressive enhancement approach
      and TDR is continuously tested to ensure that it meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards wherever possible.

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How this website was tested</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      The accessibility testing for TDR covers the successful and unsuccessful journey a
      user would take to complete a transfer of records to The National Archives.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      User journeys for both the ‘standard’ government transferring body user and the
      'judgments' courts and tribunals user were included.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      The service was assessed against the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines WCAG 2.1.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Testing was conducted by the Digital Accessibility Centre (DAC) Limited between 6th
      March to 21st March 2023.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      DAC Testing Procedure involved a team of experienced auditors and analysts, many
      of whom are disabled individuals and users of adaptive technology. The combination
      of subjective pan-disability user feedback and comprehensive technical auditing was
      used to measure how the service performs technically and practically, thereby
      offering an added dimension to test results over other methods.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Manual accessibility user testing was conducted by a team of disabled individuals,
      using a range of adaptive technologies (hardware and software designed to facilitate
      the use of computers by people with disabilities). This could include:
    </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-list--spaced">
      <li>NVDA: a screen reader and application used by those who are blind.</li>
      <li>ZoomText: a magnification application used by those with low vision.</li>
      <li>JAWS: a screen reader used by blind people to access pages.</li>
      <li>
        Dragon Naturally Speaking: voice activated software used by those that do not
        use a conventional input device such as a keyboard or mouse.
      </li>
      <li>
        Switch Access: used by those with severe mobility impairments to input
        commands to a computer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Keyboard Only: some users with mobility impairments have difficulty making
        precise movements required by pointing devices such as a mouse; therefore, a
        keyboard is used as the exclusive input device.
      </li>
      <li>
        Readability: Manual checks were made to assess the suitability of a page for
        those with colour blindness and dyslexia.
      </li>
      <li>
        Deaf/Hard of hearing: Manual checks were made to assess the suitability of a
        page for those with hearing impairments.
      </li>
      <li>
        Learning difficulties: Manual checks were made to assess the suitability of a
        page for those with learning difficulties.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reflow: tests with screen size of 1280 x 1024px, at 400% browser magnification
      </li>
      <li>
        Text Spacing: tests with larger Line height, and larger Paragraph, Word and
        Letter spacing.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Technical auditing involved the experienced application of technical auditing and
      standards compliance assessment tools.

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What we are doing to improve accessibility</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      As TDR continues to be developed, adherence to WCAG 2.1 A and AA standards is maintained throughout.
      To improve the accessibility of the service, work undertaken includes:
    </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-list--spaced">
      <li>
        recruiting users with accessibility needs as part of our user research and user
        testing participant pool
      </li>
      <li>
        working with a specialist accessibility agency to test with users of assistive
        technology
      </li>
      <li>conducting a full accessibility audit.</li>
