            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="about">About Transfer Digital Records</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Transfer Digital Records (TDR) is a secure digital transfer service from The National Archives (TNA)
                that helps Public Record Bodies prepare and transfer selected digital public records to TNA
                for permanent preservation and publication.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Under the 20-year rule, transferring bodies must transfer selected and sensitivity-reviewed digital Public Records within 20 years of the date of the record, or the last modified date where this has not been set.
                This is usually determined by the record's date last modified.
                Until then, you must safeguard the records and actively manage their digital continuity to ensure you can find, open, understand and trust them over time and through change.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                We are very happy to accept early transfers of digital records and encourage you to transfer digital records prior to the 20-year deadline.
                An advantage of transferring early is that once records are transferred, you will no longer need to manage their digital continuity.
                We also advise taking a 'little and often' approach to transferring digital records to The National Archives.
            </p>

            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="current-tdr-service">The current TDR service</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                We have created a product which provides a preparation area where records are uploaded to prepare for transfer to TNA.
                When uploaded to TDR, the records are still owned by the transferring body.
                While your records are in TDR, you will still be responsible for handling any requests such as Freedom Of Information (FOI).
                The records and their legal custody are only transferred to TNA during the final stage of the TDR process.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                TDR is currently in beta, an early agile stage of development where limited features are available.
                This means it does not yet offer the full range of features that we intend to support.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                At this stage of development, the service is only available to pre-approved users.
                Over time, TDR will be made available to more Public Record Bodies and will continue to be developed in consultation with our users.
            </p>

            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Currently we can only accept records that are Crown Copyright, Public Records and from network shared drives.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Over time, we will extend the service to accept a wider range of records.
            </p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="appraisal-selection-sensitivity-review">Appraisal, Selection and Sensitivity Review</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Transferring departments have a statutory responsibility to appraise, select and sensitivity review records prior to transferring records to The National Archives.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Any records not identified as 'closed' will be open to the public on transfer to The National Archives.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                If there are any issues detected with the appraisal, selection and sensitivity review of records, The National Archives reserves the right to pause the transfer and refer to the Strategic Compliance team.
            </p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="redacted-records">Redacted records</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                If redacted files are included within your transfer, to avoid failing checks, you must ensure that:
            </p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>They are in the same subfolder as their parent document</li>
                <li>They have the same name as their parent (excluding file extension) with '<b>_R</b>' added to the filename before the file extension e.g. <b>Parent</b>.docx and <b>Parent_R</b>.pdf</li>
                <li>There is no other file type with the same name in the same subfolder as the parent and redacted version</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                If your redacted records cannot conform to the above, contact <a href="mailto:@Messages("nationalArchives.email")">@Messages("nationalArchives.email")</a>to arrange an alternative delivery method.
            </p>
            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="before-web-browsers">Web browsers</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                We do not support Internet Explorer.
                We advise you to use the latest browser version of Edge, Chrome or Firefox to ensure you can use this service and all of its features.
            </p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="secured-access">Secured access</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                In order to keep the service and your account secure, TDR uses Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
                This means you must sign in each time using a unique generated 'one-time passcode' (OTP) that confirms your identity.
                This can be set up using a free-to-download authenticator app on your smartphone, such as Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, or FreeOTP.
                Other authenticators are also available.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Free-to-download apps are available from the App Store for iPhone, or 'Google Play' and 'Play Store' for Android.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                (See section below on <a href="#set-up-two-step-auth">setting up an OTP account for MFA</a> for more information)
            </p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="file-formats">File formats</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                To ensure that records can be successfully uploaded and pass TDR validation checks, read the following information about the file formats we do not accept before proceeding to upload your records:
            </p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>We cannot accept files that are password protected or encrypted</li>
                <li>During beta (early stage of development), we cannot accept zip files</li>
                <li>We cannot accept files that contain slashes (/ and \) in the name</li>
                <li>Files such as thumbnail images (thumbs.db), executable files (.exe) and system files are not usually selected for permanent preservation.
                    We will accept these but strongly advise that you remove them prior to upload.</li>
                <li>If uploaded, empty folders will not be transferred</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                To identify file formats, search your folder for the file extensions (thumbs.db, .exe and .zip).
                For password protected files, click to view folder options and select ‘hidden files and folders’.
                These files are usually identified as part of your selection and sensitivity review process.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                We recommend that you check your files prior to upload to ensure that you upload only selected records intended for preservation.
                During the upload and checking process, if we detect files we cannot accept, you will be notified on screen and you will be unable to proceed with your transfer.

            <p class="govuk-body">
                Before you begin, ensure your internet connection is stable and strong.

                <li>To upload your records, you must put all files into a single top-level folder. This top-level folder may contain multiple files and sub-folders. You can then either drag and drop the folder or click 'Choose Folder' to browse and select the correct top-level folder for upload.
                    <p>Confirmation is required if you want the name of the top-level folder to be displayed in the public catalogue as part of the system of arrangement.</p>
                    <p>If the top-level folder title is to be included within the system of arrangement, check the box before you continue with your transfer. Failure to select the check box to clarify this will mean that the top-level folder will be omitted from the transfer's Public Record in the catalogue.</p>
                    Before uploading, consider the following information:</li>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>You can upload one top-level folder per transfer, which can contain multiple files and sub-folders</li>
                    <li>During the upload process, basic file-level metadata is captured, such as file path, file name, last date modified, and checksum</li>

            </ol>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                At this stage, you still have legal custody of your records and are still responsible for any requests such as Freedom Of Information (FOI), until they have been acknowledged as received by TNA.

            <p class="govuk-body">
                During upload, we will identify the format of your records.
                If your records are in a format that is not known or cannot be identified, TNA may contact you post transfer to discuss these.

                <li>TDR runs a series of checks on the files to ensure they can be transferred.
                    The following checks are performed:</li>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>Antivirus</li>

                        We cannot accept infected files.
                    </p>

                    <p class="govuk-body">
                        A check performed to identify the file format and confirm that the file is suitable for transfer.
                        Knowing the format also aids TNA with preservation decisions about the record.
                    </p>
                    <li>Data integrity validation</li>
                    <p class="govuk-body">
                        A check performed to ensure files have not been corrupted as they move between your shared drive and TDR during the upload process.
                        The data integrity check uses checksums which are like a digital fingerprint.
                        For TDR we use SHA256.
                    </p>
                </ul>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="descriptive-metadata">Descriptive metadata</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">Descriptive metadata will enhance your record. Adding descriptions to your records will help the public find and understand what your record is about. We strongly encourage you to add any extra information available.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">Once you select the record you wish to add descriptive metadata to, you may provide the following information:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>Description – this will explain the content of your record and will be visible to the public, unless you confirm this is sensitive when adding Closure Metadata and provide an alternative.</li>
                <li>Date of the record – this is where you can add the last date that the record was modified if different to the date automatically determined during upload. Check this against your own information to ensure the correct date is added if required.</li>
                <li>Language - this is where you can choose the language or languages used in the record. You can also provide a translated title if the record title is not in English.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="closure-metadata">Closure metadata</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">If you wish to transfer closed records, you must add closure metadata.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Once you select the record to add closure metadata to, you must first confirm the closure status has been agreed with the Advisory Council and/or The National Archives.
                If it has been agreed, you may proceed to add information to the following fields:
            </p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>FOI decision asserted – you should enter the date that the closure schedule was agreed with the Advisory Council and/or The National Archives.</li>
                <li>Closure start date – you should enter the date of the last meaningful change to the record.</li>
                <li>Closure period – you should enter the number of years the record must be closed from the closure start date.</li>
                <li>FOI exemption code – you should search and select at least one exemption code per record.</li>
                <li>Is the title sensitive for the public? – under this question, you should confirm if the title is sensitive to the public. If it is, you can add an alternative title.</li>
                <li>Is the description sensitive for the public? – under this question, you should confirm if the description is sensitive to the public. If it is, you can add an alternative description. You can only provide an alternative description if you have already added a description on the Descriptive Metadata page.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Titles and descriptions that are sensitive to the public</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                If the title or description of your record is sensitive to the public, you can provide an alternative when adding closure metadata.
                The alternative will be visible on the public catalogue. You may wish to do one of the following:
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Redact – remove the sensitive words. For example: ‘Correspondence with [name withheld]’
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Sanitise – replace the sensitive word. For example: 'UK military exercises in xxx' (where 'military' has replaced 'Special Forces').
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Withhold the title or description without providing an alternative. For example: '[Title withheld]' and or '[description withheld]'.
            </p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="download-metadata">Step 6: Download and review metadata</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Once the metadata has been completed and automatically saved, you can download and review a .csv file which shows all the metadata added to your records.
            </p>
            <img src="@routes.Assets.versioned("images/download-and-review-metadata-page.png")" class="screenshots" alt="Download and review metadata page" />
            <p class="govuk-body">
                At this stage in the process, you may also return to the previous step to add, amend or delete metadata.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                When you have finished adding and amending metadata, click ‘Next’ to proceed to the final step of the process.
            </p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="confirm-transfer">Step 7: Confirm transfer</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                At the final stage of TDR, you will be asked to confirm the transfer. On this screen you will see a summary of the records you have uploaded.
