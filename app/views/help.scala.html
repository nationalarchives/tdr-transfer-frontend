            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="about">About Transfer Digital Records</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Transfer Digital Records (TDR) is a secure digital transfer service from The National Archives (TNA)
                that helps Public Record Bodies prepare and transfer selected digital public records to TNA
                for permanent preservation and publication.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Under the 20-year rule, transferring bodies must transfer selected and sensitivity-reviewed digital Public Records within 20 years of the date of the record, or the last modified date where this has not been set.
                This is usually determined by the record's date last modified.
                Until then, you must safeguard the records and actively manage their digital continuity to ensure you can find, open, understand and trust them over time and through change.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                We are very happy to accept early transfers of digital records and encourage you to transfer digital records prior to the 20-year deadline.
                An advantage of transferring early is that once records are transferred, you will no longer need to manage their digital continuity.
                We also advise taking a 'little and often' approach to transferring digital records to The National Archives.
            </p>

            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="current-tdr-service">The current TDR service</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                We have created a product which provides a preparation area where records are uploaded to prepare for transfer to TNA.
                When uploaded to TDR, the records are still owned by the transferring body.
                While your records are in TDR, you will still be responsible for handling any requests such as Freedom Of Information (FOI).
                The records and their legal custody are only transferred to TNA during the final stage of the TDR process.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                TDR is currently in beta, an early agile stage of development where limited features are available.
                This means it does not yet offer the full range of features that we intend to support.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                At this stage of development, the service is only available to pre-approved users.
                Over time, TDR will be made available to more Public Record Bodies and will continue to be developed in consultation with our users.
            </p>
            
            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Currently we can only accept records that are Crown Copyright, Public Records and from shared drives.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Over time, we will extend the service to accept a wider range of records.
            </p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="appraisal-selection-sensitivity-review">Appraisal, Selection and Sensitivity Review</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Transferring departments have a statutory responsibility to appraise, select and sensitivity review records prior to transferring records to The National Archives.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Any records not identified as 'closed' will be open to the public on transfer to The National Archives.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                If there are any issues detected with the appraisal, selection and sensitivity review of records, The National Archives reserves the right to pause the transfer and refer to the Strategic Compliance team.
            </p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="before-web-browsers">Web browsers</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                We do not support Internet Explorer.
                We advise you to use the latest browser version of Edge, Chrome or Firefox to ensure you can use this service and all of its features.

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="secured-access">Secured access</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                In order to keep the service and your account secure, TDR uses Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
                This means you must sign in each time using a unique generated 'one-time password' (OTP) code that confirms who you are.
                This can be set up using a free-to-download authenticator app on your smartphone, such as Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, or FreeOTP.
                Other authenticators are also available.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Free-to-download apps are available from the App Store for iPhone, or 'Google Play' and 'Play Store' for Android.
            </p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="file-formats">File formats</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                To ensure that records can be successfully uploaded and pass TDR validation checks, read the following information about the file formats we accept before proceeding to upload your records:
            </p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>We cannot accept files that are password protected or encrypted</li>
                <li>During beta, we cannot accept zip files</li>
                <li>We cannot accept files that contain slashes (/ and \) in the name</li>
                <li>Files such as thumbnail images (thumbs.db), executable files (.exe) and system files are not usually selected for permanent preservation.
                    We will accept these but strongly advise that you remove them prior to upload.</li>
                <li>If uploaded, empty folders will not be transferred</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                To identify file formats, search your folder for the file extensions (thumbs.db, .exe and .zip).
                For password protected files, click to view folder options and select ‘hidden files and folders’.
                These files are usually identified as part of your selection and sensitivity review process.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                We recommend that you check your files prior to upload to ensure that you upload only selected records intended for preservation.
                During the upload and checking process, if we detect files we cannot accept, you will be notified on screen and you will be unable to proceed with your transfer.

                <li>To upload your records, you must put all files into a single top-level folder. You can then either drag and drop a folder or click 'Choose Folder' to browse and select the correct top-level folder for upload.
                    Before uploading, consider the following information:</li>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>You can upload one top-level folder per transfer, which can contain multiple files and sub-folders</li>

            </ol>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                At this stage, you still have legal custody of your records and are still responsible for any requests such as FOI, until they have been acknowledged as received by TNA.

            <ol class="govuk-body" start="3">

            <p class="govuk-body">
                During upload, we will identify the format of your records.
                If your records are in a format that is not known or cannot be identified, TNA may contact you post transfer to discuss these.

                <li>TDR runs a series of checks on the files to ensure they can be transferred.
                    The following checks are performed:</li>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>Antivirus</li>

                        A check performed to scan for viruses and other malware.
                        We cannot accept infected files.
                    </p>
                    <li>File format identification</li>
                    <p class="govuk-body">
                        A check performed to identify the file format and confirm that the file is suitable for transfer.
                        Knowing the format also aids TNA with preservation decisions about the record.
                    </p>
                    <li>Data integrity validation</li>
                    <p class="govuk-body">
                        A check performed to ensure files have not been corrupted as they move between your shared drive and TDR during the upload process.
                        The data integrity check uses checksums which are like a digital fingerprint.
                        For TDR we use SHA256.
                    </p>
                </ul>
                <p class="govuk-body">The checking process may take several minutes.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">If your files fail TDR checks, we will inform you.
                Failing checks may mean you cannot proceed with your transfer until the problems are resolved.

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="additional-metadata">Step 5: Add, edit or delete metadata</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">You may now add, edit or delete descriptive and closure metadata.</p>
            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="descriptive-metadata">Descriptive metadata</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">You are not required to add descriptive metadata to your records, but it can enhance them.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">Once you select the file or files you wish to add descriptive metadata to, you may provide the following information:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>Description – this will be visible to the public to help explain the content of your file or files</li>
                <li>Date of record – this is prepopulated and shows the date last modified</li>
                <li>Language</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="closure-metadata">Closure metadata</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">If you wish to transfer closed files and folders, you must add closure metadata.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Once you select the file or files to add closure metadata to, you must first confirm the closure status has been approved by the Advisory Council.
                If it has been approved, you may proceed to add the following information:
            </p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>FOI decision asserted – this is the date of the Advisory Council approval</li>
                <li>Closure start date – this is the date of the last meaningful change to the record</li>
                <li>Closure period – this is the number of years the record is closed from the closure start date</li>
                <li>FOI exemption code – you should search and select at least one exemption code per file</li>
                <li>Title sensitivity – you should confirm if the title is sensitive to the public. If it is, you can add an alternative title</li>
                <li>Description Sensitivity – you can only provide an alternative description if you have set a description on the Descriptive Metadata page first</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Titles and descriptions that are sensitive to the public</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                If the title or description of your record is sensitive to the public, you can provide an alternative when adding closure metadata.
                The alternative will be visible on the public catalogue. You may wish to do one of the following:
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Redact – remove the sensitive words. For example: ‘Correspondence with [name withheld]’
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Sanitise – replace the sensitive word. For example: 'UK military exercises in xxx' (where 'military' has replaced 'Special Forces').
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Withhold the title or description without providing an alternative. For example: '[Title withheld]' and or '[description with held]'.
            </p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="download-metadata">Step 6: Download and review metadata</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Once the metadata has been completed and automatically saved, you can download and review a .csv file which shows all the metadata added to your records.
                At this stage in the process, you may also return to the previous step to add, amend or delete metadata.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                When you have finished adding and amending metadata, click ‘Next’ to proceed to the final step of the process.

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="confirm-transfer">Step 7: Confirm transfer</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                At the final stage of TDR, you will be asked to confirm the transfer. On this screen you will see a summary of the records you have uploaded.
                You may leave at any time and return to your transfer from the ‘View transfers’ page.
            </p>
            <ol class="govuk-body">
