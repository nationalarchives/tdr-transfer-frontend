            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="about">About Transfer Digital Records</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Transfer Digital Records (TDR) is a secure digital transfer service from The National Archives (TNA)
                that helps you as a Public Record Body prepare and transfer your selected digital public records to TNA
                for permanent preservation and publication.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Under the 20-year rule, you must transfer selected and sensitivity-reviewed digital public records by 20 years after they are created at the latest.
                This is usually determined by your date last modified.
                Until then, you must safeguard the records and actively manage their digital continuity to maintain your ability to find, open, understand and trust them over time and through change.
                We are very happy to accept early transfers of digital records and encourage you to transfer digital records prior to the 20-year deadline.
                There are advantages to you transferring early; once records are transferred, you will no longer need to manage their digital continuity.
                We also advise taking a 'little and often' approach to transferring digital records to The National Archives.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                TDR is an improvement on our existing service. We have created a product which provides a preparation area where records are uploaded in order to prepare for transfer to TNA.
                These uploaded records in TDR continue to be the responsibility of and owned by you, the Transferring Body.
                For example, while your records are in TDR, you will be responsible for handling any FOI requests.
                The records are only transferred to TNA during the final stage of the TDR process.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                TDR is being built using an Agile approach.
                Private beta is an early Agile stage where the service is still being developed and does not yet offer the full range of features that we intend to support.
                For example, TDR can currently only accept records that are open (i.e. no FOI exemptions apply), crown copyright and in English.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                At this private beta stage, the service is also only available to an invited group of users.
                Over time, we will make TDR available to more public record bodies and will continue to develop the service in consultation with our users, to add support for closed records and more complex types of records.
            </p>
            
            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                This service is currently in private beta, an early agile stage of development where limited features are available.
                Please be aware that at this stage, we can only accept records that are Crown Copyright, in English, open (i.e. no FOI exemptions apply) and from your shared drive.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Over time, we will extend the service to accept a wider range of records such as those in a different language, closed records and other complex types of records.

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="before-web-browsers">Web browsers</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                We do not support Internet Explorer.
                We advise you to use a different browser such as Edge, Chrome or Firefox to ensure you can use this service and all of its features.
            </p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="secured-access">Secured access</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                In order to keep the service and your account secure from attack, TDR uses Multi-factor Authentication (MFA), which needs two separate pieces of information in order to authenticate and access the service.
                This means you will be required to sign in each time using a unique generated 'one-time password' (OTP) code that confirms who you are.
                This can be set up with a free-to-download authenticator app on your smartphone, such as Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, or FreeOTP.
                Other authenticators are available.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Free-to-download apps are available from the App Store for iPhone, or 'Google Play' and 'Play Store' for Android.
            </p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="file-formats">File formats</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                To ensure that your records have the best possible chance of being successfully uploaded and passing TDR validation checks, we ask that you read the following information about the file formats we accept before proceeding to upload your records:
            </p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>We cannot accept files that are password protected or encrypted</li>
                <li>During private beta, we cannot accept zip files </li>
                <li>Files such as thumbnail images (thumbs.db) and system files are not usually selected for permanent preservation.
                    We will accept these but strongly advise you remove them prior to upload.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                To identify these files, search your folder for the file extensions (thumb.dbs, .exe and .zip).
                For password protected files, click to view folder options and select ‘hidden files and folders’.
                These files should usually be identified as part of your selection and sensitivity review process.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                We recommend that you check your files prior to upload to ensure that you upload only selected records intended for preservation.
                During the upload and checking process, if we detect files we cannot accept, you will be notified on screen and you will be unable to proceed with your transfer.

            <p class="govuk-body">
                Before you begin, ensure your internet connection is stable and strong.

                <li>To upload your records, you can either drag and drop a folder OR click 'Choose Folder' to browse and select a folder for upload.
                    Before uploading, consider the following information:</li>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>You can upload one top-level folder per transfer, which can contain multiple files and sub-folders</li>

                    <li>During private beta, we cannot accept zip files</li>
                    <li>Files such as thumbnail images (thumbs.db) and system files are not usually selected for permanent preservation.
                        We strongly advise you do not upload these</li>
                    <li>During the upload process, basic file-level metadata is captured, such as file path, file name, date (usually last modified), and checksum</li>

                <li>If you need to change the folder selected, click the blue 'Remove' link next to the line confirming which folder has been selected and then start the selection again.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Please note, when you upload your records, you still have legal custody over them and are still responsible for any FOI requests until they have been acknowledged as received by TNA.

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="file-checks">Step four: File checks</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                During upload, we will identify the format of your records.
                If your records are in a format that is not known, TNA may contact you post transfer to discuss these.
            </p>

                <li>TDR runs a series of checks on the files to ensure they can be transferred.
                    The following checks are performed:</li>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>Antivirus</li>

                        A check performed to scan for viruses and other malware.
                        We cannot accept infected files.
                    </p>
                    <li>File format identification</li>
                    <p class="govuk-body">
                        A check performed to identify the file format and confirm that the file is suitable for transfer.
                        Knowing the format also aids TNA with preservation decisions about the record.
                        We accept most digital formats, but ones we haven’t seen before may need further investigation.
                        We may contact you if your transfer contains file formats that we can’t identify.
                    </p>
                    <li>Validating data integrity</li>
                    <p class="govuk-body">
                        A check performed to ensure files have not been corrupted as they move between your shared drive and TDR during the upload process.
                        The data integrity check uses checksums which are like a digital fingerprint used to ensure the data has not changed.
                        For TDR we use SHA256.
                    </p>
                </ul>
                <p class="govuk-body">The checking process is likely to take several minutes.</p>

            </ol>
            <p class="govuk-body">If your files fail TDR checks, we will inform you.
                Failing checks may mean you cannot proceed with your transfer until the problems are resolved.

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="confirm-transfer">Step five: Confirm transfer</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">At the final stage of TDR, you will be asked to confirm transfer.</p>
            <ol class="govuk-body">
                <li>Click both boxes to confirm that the records uploaded are open, and that you consent to transferring legal custody to The National Archives.</li>

            <p class="govuk-body">
                Please note, until you are notified that your records have been successfully transferred AND are live on Discovery, it is important that you keep your originating records safe and do not delete them.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                During private beta, this process can take up to 90 days.

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="glossary-anti-virus">Anti-virus scan</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                A check performed on digital files to detect the presence of computer viruses or other malware.
                We do not accept files that contain viruses or malware and so if these are detected the upload will fail.
            </p>
            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="glossary-consignment">Consignment</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                A consignment is a group of selected records being prepared and transferred to The National Archives.
                Sometimes referred to as a batch.
            </p>
            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="glossary-consignment-reference">Consignment reference </h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Each consignment of digital records uploaded to TDR for transfer to The National Archives is assigned a consignment reference which can be identified as a series of letters and numbers.
                Please quote this reference if you need to contact us about your records transfer.
            </p>
            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="glossary-creating-body">Creating body</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                The government department or body that originally created the records being transferred.
                This is often the same as the body that transfers the records.
            </p>
            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="glossary-crown-copyright">Crown Copyright </h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Under section 163 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, Crown Copyright is defined as works made by officers or servants of the Crown in the course of their duties.
                This includes material created by ministers, civil servants and government departments and agencies.
                Copyright can also be assigned or transferred to the Crown by the legal owner of the copyright.
                Most, though not all, Public Records are Crown Copyright.
            </p>
            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="glossary-data-integrity-check">Data integrity check</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                When you upload your digital records to TDR, we carry out data integrity checks to help ensure that files have not been corrupted during the upload process.
                The integrity check uses checksums which are like digital fingerprints used to verify that no changes have been made to the data.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                The checksum hash we use is SHA 256.

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="glossary-departmental-records-officer">Departmental Records Officer</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                A Departmental Records Officer (DRO) is a person appointed by a government department or agency as being responsible for the management of the records of that organisation.
                The DRO must authorise any transfer of records to The National Archives and is responsible for ensuring that the records are properly sensitivity reviewed prior to transfer.
            </p>
            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="glossary-foi-exemption">Freedom of Information (FOI) exemption</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                FOI exemptions exist to protect information that should not be disclosed.
                A list of exemptions can be found in Part II of the Freedom of Information Act, at sections 21 to 44.
                Records transferred to The National Archives will be released to the public (‘opened’) unless you apply one or more FOI exemptions.
            </p>
            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="glossary-metadata">Metadata</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Data that provides additional information about digital records.
                For example, information that could help a user find or understand a record, locate other related information or understand how the record was originally created or used.
            </p>
            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="glossary-private-beta">Private beta</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                The Transfer Digital Records service is still being developed and is currently at a 'private beta' stage.
                At this stage in its development, TDR does not yet offer the full range of features which our users require (for example, TDR can currently only accept records which are Open, Crown Copyright and in English).
                The service is currently only available to an invited group of users.
            </p>
            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="glossary-public-records">Public Records</h3>

            <p class="govuk-body">
                Records held by local authorities, educational institutions, businesses or private individuals are not usually Public Records.
                If you need advice on whether the records you hold are Public Records please contact us.
