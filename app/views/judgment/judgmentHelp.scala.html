                        Transfer Digital Records (TDR) is a secure digital transfer service from The National Archives (TNA) that enables Public Record Bodies to upload, prepare and then transfer selected digital public records to TNA for permanent archiving and publication.

                        In order to keep the service and your account secure, TDR uses Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), which needs two separate pieces of information in order to authenticate and grant access to the service. This means you are required to sign in each time using a unique generated 'one-time password' (OTP) code that confirms who you are. This can be set up with a free-to-download authenticator app on your smartphone, such as Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, or FreeOTP. Other authenticators are also available.

                        You must only upload a single Microsoft Word (.docx) document per transfer, using the template supplied by the Judiciary Office Judgments Helpdesk.

                        An OTP (one-time password) is a unique code that confirms your identity. Itâ€™s generated by an authenticator app on your smartphone. You can download one of these free authenticator apps: Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, or FreeOTP. These apps are available on the App Store for iPhone, or Google Play for Android.
