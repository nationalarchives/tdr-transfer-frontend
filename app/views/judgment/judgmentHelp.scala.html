        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="about">About this service</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          Transfer Digital Records (TDR) is a secure digital transfer service from The National Archives (TNA) that enables Public Record Bodies to upload, prepare and then transfer selected digital public records to TNA for permanent archiving and publication.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          For anyone involved in recording judgments, this service is used to send the final approved judgment to TNA for preservation and publication on the 'Find Case Law' website <a href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk">https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          Sending judgments via TDR is in two stages:
        </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>First you will upload your judgment onto TDR </li>
          <li>Then your document will be scanned to check for viruses etc.</li>
          <li>If your document passes these checks, it will automatically be submitted for transfer to TNA</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="web-browsers">Web browsers</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          We do not support Internet Explorer. We advise you to use a different browser such as Edge, Chrome or Firefox to ensure you can use this service and all of its features.
        </p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="secured-access">Secured access</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          In order to keep the service and your account secure, TDR uses Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), which needs two separate pieces of information in order to authenticate and grant access to the service. This means you are required to sign in each time using a unique generated 'one-time password' (OTP) code that confirms who you are. This can be set up with a free-to-download authenticator app on your smartphone, such as Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, or FreeOTP. Other authenticators are also available.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          Free-to-download apps are available from the App Store for iPhone, or 'Google Play' and 'Play Store' for Android.
        </p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="file-format">File format</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          You must only upload a single Microsoft Word (.docx) document per transfer, using the template supplied by the Judiciary Office Judgments Helpdesk. During upload and checking, if we detect a file we cannot accept, you will be notified on screen. For more information about the types of files we accept, contact <a href="mailto:@Messages("judiciary.email")">@Messages("judiciary.email")</a>
        </p>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="supplementary-material">Supplementary material</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          If supporting documents, such as photos, need to be preserved with a judgment, they must be emailed to the TNA Find Case Law editorial team with the transfer reference of the judgment they relate to. Full details on how to do this can be found <a href="#supp-material">
          here</a>.

        <ol class="govuk-body">
          <li>
            If your department has not requested a new account registration for you, you can register for a new TDR account by emailing <a href="mailto:@Messages("nationalArchives.email")">
            @Messages("nationalArchives.email")</a>
            from your work email account. In the email you should ask to register as a new user, stating clearly your first name and surname. Allow up to two working days for your request to be processed. </li>
          <li>
            Once your account is validated, you will be sent an email with the subject <span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">"Register for your Transfer Digital Records (TDR) account - ACTION REQUIRED"</span> which contains important registration instructions.</li>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          A 'one-time password' (OTP) code is a unique generated code that confirms who you are. An OTP code is generated in an authenticator app. Free authenticator apps can be downloaded onto your smartphone, such as Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, or FreeOTP. Other authenticators are available. Free-to-download apps are available from the App Store for iPhone, or 'Google Play' and 'Play Store' for Android.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          To keep the service and your account secure, you must sign in to your account using an OTP in addition to your personal password.

            For Microsoft Authenticator, first click on the '+' icon to add an account. You might need to click on the three little dots in the top right corner to have this option displayed. Then select "Other (Google, Facebook, etc.)" to access the QR scanner.
          </li>
          <li>For Free OTP, click on the QR code icon located in the top banner of your smartphone screen.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="govuk-body">Scan the QR code displayed on your computer screen and your app will automatically create a unique OTP account to use with TDR. You should now see a 6-digit code that will refresh at regular intervals.</p>

            If the code doesn't work, wait for the app to refresh and generate a new code and try using that instead.
