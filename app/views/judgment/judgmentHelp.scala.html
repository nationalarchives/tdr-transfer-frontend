        <p class="govuk-body">
          Transfer Digital Records (TDR) is a secure digital transfer service from The National Archives (TNA) that enables Public Record Bodies to upload, prepare and then transfer selected digital public records to TNA for permanent archiving and publication.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          For anyone involved in recording judgments, this service is used to send the final approved judgment to TNA for preservation and publication on the 'Find Case Law' website <a href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk">https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          Sending via TDR is a two stage process:
        </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>First you will upload your judgment into TDR </li>
          <li>Then you will be prompted to export your judgment for transfer to TNA</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="web-browsers">Web browsers</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          We do not support Internet Explorer (IE11). We advise you to use a different browser such as Edge, Chrome, Safari or Firefox to ensure you can use this service and all of its features.
        </p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="secured-access">Secured access</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          In order to keep the service and your account secure from attack, TDR uses Multi-factor Authentication (MFA), which needs two separate pieces of information in order to authenticate and access the service. This means you will be required to sign in each time using a unique generated 'one-time password' (OTP) code that confirms who you are. This can be set up with a free-to-download authenticator app on your smartphone, such as Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, or FreeOTP. Other authenticators are available.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          Free-to-download apps are available from the App Store for iPhone, or 'Google Play' and 'Play Store' for Android.
        </p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="file-format">File format</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          Double-check your judgment prior to upload to ensure you are sending us the correct file.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          Only upload a single Microsoft Word (.docx) document per transfer, using the template supplied by the Judiciary Office Judgments Helpdesk, contactable at <a href="mailto:@Messages("judiciary.email")">@Messages("judiciary.email")</a>
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          During upload and checking, if we detect a file we cannot accept, you will be notified on screen.

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="supplementary-material">Supplementary material</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          Occasionally other supporting documents, such as photos, need preserving with the judgment. When this happens, they will need to be emailed to TNA Case Law editorial team with the transfer reference of the judgment they relate to. Full details on how to do this can be found <a href="#supp-material">
          here</a>.
