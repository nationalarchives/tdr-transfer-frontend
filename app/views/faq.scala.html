                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What is TDR?</h3>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    Transfer Digital Records (TDR) is a secure digital transfer service from The National Archives (TNA) that enables Public Record Bodies to upload, prepare and then transfer selected digital Public Records to TNA for permanent preservation and publication.
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    TDR is a preparation area where records are uploaded to prepare for transfer. Whilst records remain uploaded in TDR, they continue to be the responsibility of and owned by the transferring body. For example, while records are in TDR the transferring body will still be accountable for any requests such as FOI. The custody of records is only transferred to TNA when exported during the final stage of the TDR process.
                </p>

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What are selected digital public records?</h3>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    These are records of historical value and enduring public interest that have been selected for permanent preservation.
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    Transferring departments have a statutory responsibility to appraise, select and sensitivity review records prior to transferring records to The National Archives.
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    If there are any issues detected with the appraisal, selection and sensitivity review of records, The National Archives reserves the right to pause the transfer and refer to the Strategic Compliance team.
                </p>

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">How does TDR work?</h3>
                <p class="govuk-body">A digital records transfer using TDR involves the following steps:</p>
                <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
                    <li>Users select the series reference for their transfer and confirm service agreement requirements.</li>
                    <li>Users upload selected digital records to TDR</li>
                    <li>TDR checks that the records are free of computer viruses or other malware</li>
                    <li>Users add, edit or delete descriptive and closure metadata.</li>
                    <li>Users are asked to confirm that the records have been selected, sensitivity reviewed and meet TNA's requirements for transfer</li>
                    <li>If all checks have been passed, users can formally transfer custody of the records to TNA on the Confirm Transfer page by clicking 'Transfer your records'.</li>
                    <li>On successful transfer to TNA the user is informed that they have arrived securely for onwards processing at TNA.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    TNA takes formal custody and becomes legally responsible for the records at step 7 of the process.
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    Once received at The National Archives, the records will be preserved and where appropriate released on the public catalogue.
                </p>

                <h3 id="beta" class="govuk-heading-s">What is beta?</h3>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    TDR is being built using an agile approach. Beta is an early agile stage where the service is still being developed and does not yet offer the full range of features that we intend to support. For example, TDR can currently only accept records that are Crown Copyright.
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    At this development stage, the service is also only available to pre-approved users. Over time, we will make TDR available to more departments and will continue to develop the service in consultation with our users. If you would like to user TDR contact our transfer advisors on <a href="mailto:@Messages("nationalArchives.email")">@Messages("nationalArchives.email")</a>

                <h3 id="what-is-mfa" class="govuk-heading-s">What is Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)?</h3>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    To keep the service and your account secure, you are required to sign-in each time using Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). This uses two separate pieces of information to authenticate and grant access to the service. In TDR you must sign in each time using your password and a unique generated 'one-time password' (OTP) code that confirms who you are. This can be set up with a free-to-download authenticator app on your smartphone device, such as Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, or FreeOTP. Other authenticators are also available.
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    Free-to-download apps are available from the App Store for iPhone, or 'Google Play' and 'Play Store' for Android.

                    in order to set up a TDR account in the authenticator app on a smartphone device that you have access to. You only need to configure this once for it to generate a code for each time you sign in.

                <p class="govuk-body">
                    Click on the TDR account that you set up in the authenticator app to see a one-time passcode being generated every 30 to 60 seconds. Ensure you have enough time to use the code to complete the sign-in process before the code refreshes.

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What is a series reference?</h3>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    A series reference is a label assigned to a set of archived records. Series references generally contain letters that indicate the creating department followed by numbers referring to the series, for example 'DCMS-1234'. The Cataloguing Department at The National Archives allocates the series references.
                </p>

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">I cannot choose my series reference</h3>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    If you cannot find your series reference in the dropdown list on the ‘Series reference’ page, or you are unsure what your series reference should be when you begin the transfer process, contact <a href="mailto:@Messages("nationalArchives.email")">
                @Messages("nationalArchives.email")</a>.
                </p>

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What is a consignment reference?</h3>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    A consignment reference is a unique label assigned to each consignment (batch) of digital records that have been uploaded to TDR, for example 'MOCK-123-TDR'. The View Transfers page will show you your consignment reference. It will also be displayed in the top right-hand corner of your screen once you have begun a transfer.
                </p>

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What are Public Records?</h3>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    Public Records are records created or held by any UK government department or related body. The National Archives can usually only accept Public Records.
                </p>

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">How do I know if my records are Crown Copyright?</h3>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    Works created by officers or servants of the Crown during the course of their duties are Crown Copyright. This includes material created by ministers, civil servants, government departments and agencies. In the future The National Archives will accept Public Records that are not Crown Copyright, however during this initial development stage, you cannot use TDR to transfer them to us.
                </p>

                <h3 id="other-languages" class="govuk-heading-s">
                    The records I wish to transfer are in another language (for example, Welsh)</h3>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    The National Archives accepts records in any language.
                </p>

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What file formats are accepted?</h3>
                <p class="govuk-body">We cannot accept files that are password protected or encrypted.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">We cannot accept files with slashes (/ and \) in the name.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    We also cannot currently accept zip files via TDR. Contact <a href="mailto:@Messages("nationalArchives.email")">
                @Messages("nationalArchives.email")</a> if you wish to transfer these.
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">If you upload an empty folder it will not be transferred.</p>

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">
                    Do you accept system files, password protected files, executable files, or zip files and folders and how do I identify them?</h3>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    System files, including 'thumbs.db' files, ds_store files, and .lnk files are not usually selected for permanent preservation. We advise you to remove these from your consignment.
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Password protected files are not accepted and must be removed prior to transfer.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    Executable files, such as those with a .exe or .msi extension are not usually selected for transfer but there may be a good reason for selecting them. Ensure you are certain that you wish to upload such files prior to transfer.
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    Zips, and similar 'archival container' files including .rar, .7z, .gz and others must be unpacked prior to transfer. Failure to do so will likely cause the transfer to fail. Speak with your local IT Support team if you require assistance with this.
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    File format extensions can also be useful for determining file types, however this can be an unreliable approach, since they can be changed easily. Extensions are the end part of a filename that typically look similar to '.jpg' or '.docx'. They are often hidden by default, but can usually be made visible to help with determining file type. Speak with your local IT Support team if you require assistance with this.
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    To identify file formats, search you folder for the file extensions (thumbs.db, .exe and .zip). For password protected files, click to view folder options and select 'hidden files and folders'. These files are usually identified as part of your selection and sensitivity review process.
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Contact <a href="mailto:@Messages("nationalArchives.email")">
                @Messages("nationalArchives.email")</a>
                    if you have any uncertainty about the file formats you have selected for transfer.
                </p>

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Why can’t I drag and drop or upload my records?</h3>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    This may happen for several reasons. To try to resolve the issue, first check your internet connection is sufficient and stable. It may also help to refresh the page though this might mean you have to begin the transfer process again. You can also check your sub-folders and files are not corrupted or damaged by opening them on your computer. If you still cannot upload your files and sub-folders, contact <a href="mailto:@Messages("nationalArchives.email")">@Messages("nationalArchives.email")</a>
                    describing the issue and any steps taken.
                </p>

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Can I upload multiple folders?</h3>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    You can only upload one content folder per consignment. However, that folder can contain multiple files and sub-folders.
                </p>

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Is there an upload limit?</h3>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    We recommend that each file is no more than 2GB and that you upload no more than 500 files per consignment.
                    Uploading more than the recommended size increases the likelihood of errors occurring and may take longer
                    to be uploaded and checked. If your files are very large and cannot be uploaded, contact
                    <a href="mailto:@Messages("nationalArchives.email")">@Messages("nationalArchives.email")</a>.
                </p>

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Can I upload a folder via OneDrive/ Google Drive/ SharePoint?</h3>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    While we are developing the service (Beta stage), TDR can only accept records transferred from a hard or network drive. Contact <a href="mailto:@Messages("nationalArchives.email")">
                @Messages("nationalArchives.email")</a>
                    to discuss the best way to transfer records if they are not stored on a physical or networked drive.
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    In the future, TDR will accept consignments transferred directly from the cloud.
                </p>

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">I’ve uploaded files or sub-folders that I do not wish to be transferred</h3>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    Currently, if you upload files or sub-folders you do not wish to transfer you will need to contact <a href="mailto:@Messages("nationalArchives.email")">
                @Messages("nationalArchives.email")</a>
                    and begin the process again. Prior to upload, check that each of the files and sub-folders are intended to be uploaded and transferred. TDR does not currently allow you to amend your files once the transfer process has begun.

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">The session timed out before I completed the upload process</h3>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    A session can time out during the upload process if your internet connection is weak or if your files are very large. If so, you can continue with your transfer if your records were uploaded successfully via the View Transfers page. If your records were not uploaded successfully you must begin the process again. To avoid the session timing out, ensure you have a sufficiently stable and strong internet connection.

                <p class="govuk-body">
                    If you close your browser during upload your records may not be uploaded successfully. You will need to return to the start and begin the upload process again.

                <p class="govuk-body">
                    During upload, files are checked to ensure they can be transferred. The following checks are performed:
                </p>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li >Antivirus</li>
                    <p class="govuk-body">
                        A check performed to scan for viruses and other malware. We cannot accept infected files.
                    </p>
                    <li>File format identification</li>
                    <p class="govuk-body">
                        A check performed to identify the file format and confirm that the file is suitable for transfer. We accept most types of formats, but ones we haven’t seen before may need further investigation. You may be contacted if your transfer contains unidentified file formats. See 'What file formats are accepted' for guidance on what types of files we can accept.
                    </p>
                    <li>Data integrity validation</li>
                    <p class="govuk-body">
                        A check performed to ensure files have not been corrupted as they move between your shared drive and TDR during the upload process. The data integrity check uses checksums which are like a digital fingerprint. For TDR we use SHA256.
                    </p>

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Once I have uploaded my records does that mean TNA now has them?</h3>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    Upload and export are two completely different stages within the transfer process. Uploading records into TDR <span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">

                    mean that The National Archives has them. When files have only been uploaded, checks are carried out on your records to help you confirm that they are suitable for transfer. At this point you are still responsible for them, including responsibility for FOI requests.
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    Once the checks are completed, you will be prompted to confirm that you wish to transfer custody of the records to The National Archives. This is the export stage. We only take custody of your records once you confirm the transfer of custody at the export and final stage of the process.
                </p>

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">At what point have I transferred the records?</h3>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    Once your records have been uploaded and checked, you will be prompted to confirm that you wish to transfer them to The National Archives. You should keep a copy of your records until we confirm preservation at The National Archives. We will endeavour to complete this within 90 days, however it could take longer. We will also notify you when your records have been released to the public.
                </p>

                <h3 id="metadata-captured" class="govuk-heading-s">What metadata will be captured in TDR?</h3>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    During the upload process, TDR  captures the following metadata from the consignment:
                </p>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>File path</li>
                    <li>File name</li>
                    <li>Date (usually last modified)</li>
                    <li>Type (distinction between folder and file)</li>
                    <li>Checksum</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    The format of the file is also identified using <a href="https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/manage-information/preserving-digital-records/droid/">
                    DROID</a> which was developed by The National Archives.
                </p>

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Why are you asking me to add descriptive metadata?</h3>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    During the upload process, TDR captures basic file-level metadata. If you have additional information about your records, we recommend that you add this. It can include anything from descriptions to dates and any additional data that will provide context to the record and make it easier to find in the future. For further assistance, contact <a href="mailto:@Messages("nationalArchives.email")">
                @Messages("nationalArchives.email")</a>.

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">
                    What do I do if the title or description of my record is sensitive to the public?</h3>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    If the title or description of your record is sensitive to the public, you can provide an alternative when adding closure metadata. The alternative will be visible on the public catalogue. You may wish to do one of the following:
                </p>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>Redact - remove the sensitive words. For example: 'Correspondence with [name withheld]'.</li>
                    <li>Sanitise - replace the sensitive word. For example: 'UK military exercises in xx' (where 'military' has replaced 'Special Forces').</li>
                    <li>Withhold the title or description without providing an alternative. For example: '[Title withheld]' and or '[description withheld]'</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Can I include Redacted records?</h3>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    If redacted files are included within your transfer, to avoid failing checks, you must ensure that:
                </p>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>They are in the same subfolder as their parent document</li>
                    <li>They have the same name as their parent (excluding file extension) with '<b>_R</b>' added to the filename before the file extension e.g. <b>Parent</b>.docx and <b>Parent_R</b>.pdf</li>
                    <li>There is no other file type with the same name in the same subfolder as the parent and redacted version</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    If your redacted records cannot conform to the above, contact <a href="mailto:@Messages("nationalArchives.email")">@Messages("nationalArchives.email")</a>to arrange an alternative delivery method.
                </p>
                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">
                    Why do I need to export my records when I have already uploaded them to TDR?</h3>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    TDR is a service that prepares records to be transferred. When you upload your records, you still have legal custody over them and are still responsible for any requests such as FOI. At the final stage of TDR you will be asked to confirm that you wish to transfer custody of your records to TNA. When confirmed, both the records and legal custody will be exported to TNA.
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    Until you are notified that your records have been successfully preserved and are live on the public catalogue, it is important that you keep your records safe and do not delete them or alternatively, keep a copy of your records.

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">
                    Do I need to wait for a notification before I can transfer another consignment?
