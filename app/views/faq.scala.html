            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Getting started</h2>
            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What is TDR?</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Transfer Digital Records (TDR) is a secure digital transfer service from The National Archives (TNA) that enables Public Record Bodies to upload, prepare and then transfer selected digital public records to TNA for permanent preservation and publication.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                TDR is a preparation area where records are uploaded to prepare for transfer. Whilst records remain uploaded in TDR, they continue to be the responsibility of and owned by the transferring body. For example, while records are in TDR the transferring body will still be accountable for any FOI requests. The custody of records is only transferred to TNA when exported during the final stage of the TDR process.
            </p>
            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">How does TDR work?</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">A digital records transfer using TDR involves the following steps:</p>
            <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
                <li>Users download DROID and create a metadata CSV for additional metadata</li>
                <li>Users upload selected digital records to TDR</li>
                <li>TDR checks that the records are free of computer viruses or other malware</li>
                <li>TDR runs DROID to identify file formats and generate some basic file-level metadata</li>
                <li>Users are asked to confirm that the records have been selected, sensitivity reviewed and meet our requirements for transfer</li>
                <li>If all checks have been passed, users can formally transfer custody of the records to The National Archives</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Please note, TNA takes formal custody and becomes legally responsible for the records at stage 6 of the process.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Once received at The National Archives, the records will be preserved and (where appropriate) released to the public via <a href="https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/">
                Discovery</a>.
            </p>

            <h3 id="private-beta" class="govuk-heading-s">What is private beta?</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                TDR is being built using an agile approach. Private beta is an early agile stage where the service is still being developed and does not yet offer the full range of features that we intend to support. For example, TDR can currently only accept records that are open (i.e. no FOI exemptions apply), Crown copyright and in English.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                At this private beta stage, the service is also only available to an invited group of users. Over time, we will make TDR available to more departments and will continue to develop the service in consultation with our users, to add support for closed records and more complex types of records.
            </p>

            <h3 id="browsers-supported" class="govuk-heading-s">What browsers are supported?</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                We do not support Internet Explorer (IE11). We advise you to use a different browser such as Edge, Chrome, Safari or Firefox to ensure you can use this service and all of its features.
            </p>

            <h3 id="sign-in-email" class="govuk-heading-s">Which email should I use to sign-in?</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Use the email that you used to create your account. If your email address changes, send full details of the change to <a href="mailto:tdr@@nationalarchives.gov.uk">tdr@@nationalarchives.gov.uk</a>.
            </p>

            <h3 id="password-not-working" class="govuk-heading-s">My password does not work</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                If you forget your password or need to reset it, click the ‘Forgot your password?’ link on the sign in page to request a reset and follow the on-screen instructions. For any other password issue, email <a href="mailto:tdr@@nationalarchives.gov.uk">tdr@@nationalarchives.gov.uk</a>.
            </p>

            <h3 id="what-is-mfa" class="govuk-heading-s">What is multi-factor authentication (MFA)?</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                To keep the service and your account secure from attack, you will be required to sign-in each time using MFA, which uses two separate pieces of information in order to authenticate and access the service. In TDR you will be required to sign in each time using your password and a unique generated 'one-time password' (OTP) code that confirms who you are. This can be set up with a free-to-download authenticator app on your smartphone device, such as Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, or FreeOTP. Other authenticators are available.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Free-to-download apps are available from the App Store for iPhone, or 'Google Play' and 'Play Store'.
            </p>

            <h3 id="set-up-mfa-otp" class="govuk-heading-s">How do I set up MFA and my one-time password (OTP)?</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                When you register as a new TDR user, follow the registration steps in the TDR guidance supplied in order to set up a TDR-related account in the authenticator app on your own smartphone device. You will only need to configure this once for it to generate a code for each time you sign-in.
            </p>

            <h3 id="where-to-get-otp-code" class="govuk-heading-s">Where do I get my OTP code?</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Within the authenticator app, click on the TDR-related account that you set up to see a one-time passcode being generated every 30 to 60 seconds. Ensure you have enough time to use the code to complete sign-in before the code is refreshed.
            </p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">When setting up the authenticator app, my configuration has failed - what should I do?</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                If the authentication app fails to configure when adding a new account for TDR on your device, delete the failed TDR-related account within the app and try again. How you do this depends on the type of device you are using.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">

                <li>Within your authenticator app look for the 'Enter a setup key' option and click that.</li>
                <li>Enter the Key code as shown into the app and it should create your unique OTP account for TDR sign in.</li>
                <li>You should now be able to see a 6-digit code that will refresh at regular intervals.</li>
                <li>Continue to follow instructions from 'Part 2: Step 3'.</li>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What is a series reference?</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                A series reference is a label assigned to a set of archived records. Series references generally contain letters that indicate the creating department followed by numbers referring to the series. The Cataloguing Department at The National Archives allocate the series references.
            </p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">I cannot choose my series reference</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                If you cannot find your series reference in the dropdown list on the ‘Series reference’ page when you begin the transfer process, contact <a href="mailto:tdr@@nationalarchives.gov.uk">
                tdr@@nationalarchives.gov.uk</a>.
            </p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What is a consignment reference?</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                A consignment reference is a unique label assigned to each consignment (batch) of digital records that have been uploaded to TDR. Your dashboard and transfer summary will show you your consignment reference. It will also be displayed in the top right-hand corner of your screen once you have begun a transfer.
            </p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What are Public Records?</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Public Records are records created or held by any UK government department or related body. The National Archives can usually only accept Public Records.
            </p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">How do I know if my records are Crown copyright?</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Works created by officers or servants of the crown during the course of their duties are Crown copyright. This includes material created by ministers, civil servants, government departments and agencies. The National Archives will accept Public Records that are not Crown copyright, however during this initial private beta stage, you cannot currently use TDR to transfer them to us.
            </p>

            <h3 id="other-languages" class="govuk-heading-s">The records I wish to transfer are in another language (for example, Welsh)</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                The National Archives accepts records in any language. However, during this initial private beta stage, TDR can only accept records that are in English. Contact <a href="mailto:tdr@@nationalarchives.gov.uk">
                tdr@@nationalarchives.gov.uk</a> to discuss the best way to transfer records that are not in English.
            </p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What file formats are accepted?</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">We cannot accept files that are password protected or encrypted.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                We also cannot currently accept zip files via TDR. Contact <a href="mailto:tdr@@nationalarchives.gov.uk">
                tdr@@nationalarchives.gov.uk</a> if you wish to transfer these.
            </p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">How do I identify system files, password protected files, executable files, or zip files and folders within my consignment?</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                System files, including 'thumbs.db' files, ds_store files, and .lnk files are not usually selected for permanent preservation. We advise you remove these from your consignment.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">Password protected files are not accepted and must be removed prior to transfer.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Executable files, such as those with a .exe or .msi extension are not usually selected for transfer but there may be a good reason for selecting them. Ensure you are certain that you wish to upload such files prior to transfer.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Zips, and similar 'archival container' files including .rar, .7z, .gz and others must be unpacked prior to transfer. Failure to do so will likely cause the transfer to fail. Speak with your local IT Support team if you require assistance with this.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                The <a href="https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/manage-information/preserving-digital-records/droid/">
                DROID tool</a> can help with identifying these files, particularly password protected files which are not immediately obvious by extension alone. File format extensions can also be useful for determining file types, however this can be an unreliable approach, since they can be changed easily. Extensions are the end part of a filename that typically look similar to '.jpg' or '.docx'. They are often hidden by default, but can usually be made visible to help with determining file type. Speak with your local IT Support team if you require assistance with this.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">Contact <a href="mailto:tdr@@nationalarchives.gov.uk">
                tdr@@nationalarchives.gov.uk</a> if you have any uncertainty about the file formats you have selected for transfer.
            </p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Why can’t I drag and drop or upload files?</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                This may happen for several reasons. To try to resolve the issue, first check your internet connection is sufficient and stable. It may also help to refresh the page (though this might mean you have to begin the transfer process again). You can also check your folder is not corrupted or damaged by opening it on your computer. If you still cannot upload your files, contact <a href="mailto:tdr@@nationalarchives.gov.uk">tdr@@nationalarchives.gov.uk</a> describing the issue and any steps taken.
            </p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Can I upload multiple folders?</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                You can only upload one content folder per consignment. However, that folder can contain multiple files and sub-folders.
            </p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Is there an upload limit?</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                We recommend that each file is no more than 2GB and that you upload no more than 500 files per consignment.
                Uploading more than the recommended size increases the likelihood of errors occurring and may take longer
                to be uploaded and checked. If your files are very large and cannot be uploaded, contact
                <a href="mailto:tdr@@nationalarchives.gov.uk">tdr@@nationalarchives.gov.uk</a>.
            </p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Can I upload a folder via OneDrive/ Google Drive/ SharePoint?</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                While we are developing the service (Private Beta stage), TDR can only accept records transferred from a hard or network drive. Contact <a href="mailto:tdr@@nationalarchives.gov.uk">
                tdr@@nationalarchives.gov.uk</a> to discuss the best way to transfer records if they are not stored on a physical or networked drive.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                In the future, TDR will begin accepting consignments transferred directly from the cloud.
            </p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">I’ve uploaded files that I do not wish to be transferred</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                During private beta, if you upload files you do not wish to transfer you will need to contact <a href="mailto:tdr@@nationalarchives.gov.uk">
                tdr@@nationalarchives.gov.uk</a> and begin the process again. Prior to upload, check that each of the files are intended to be uploaded and transferred. The easiest way to remove files you do not wish to be transferred, is to remove those files prior to upload. TDR does not currently allow you to amend your files once the transfer process has begun.
            </p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">The session timed out before I completed the upload process</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                A session can time out during the upload process if your internet connection is weak or if your files are very large. If so, you can continue with your transfer. If your files were not uploaded successfully you must begin the process again. To avoid the session timing out, ensure you have a sufficiently stable and strong internet connection.
            </p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What happens if I close my browser accidentally during upload?</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                If you close your browser during upload your records may not be uploaded successfully. You will need to return to the start and begin the upload process again.
            </p>

            <h3 id="progress-checks" class="govuk-heading-s">What checks are carried out?</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                During upload, files are checked to ensure they can be transferred. The following checks are performed:
            </p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li >Antivirus</li>
                    <p class="govuk-body">
                        A check performed to scan for viruses and other malware. We cannot accept infected files.
                    </p>
                <li>File format identification</li>
                    <p class="govuk-body">
                        A check performed to identify the file format and confirm that the file is suitable for transfer. We accept most types of formats, but ones we haven’t seen before may need further investigation. You may be contacted if your transfer contains unidentified file formats. See 'What file formats are accepted' for guidance on what types of files we can accept.
                    </p>
                <li>Validating data integrity</li>
                    <p class="govuk-body">
                        A check performed to ensure files have not been corrupted as it moves between your shared drive and TDR during the upload process. The data integrity check uses checksums which are like a digital fingerprint used to ensure the data has retained its integrity.
                    </p>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What happens if my files fail?</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                If you receive a failure notification on the TDR page after the checks, please check the following:
            </p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>Your internet connection</li>
                <li>That your consignment does not contain records we cannot accept.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="govuk-body">If you can confirm the above then try again. If your consignment has still failed, contact <a href="mailto:tdr@@nationalarchives.gov.uk">
                tdr@@nationalarchives.gov.uk</a>.
            </p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Once I have uploaded my records does that mean TNA now has them?</h3>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    Upload and export are two completely different stages within the transfer process. Uploading records into TDR <span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">does not</span> mean that The National Archives has them. When files have only been uploaded, checks are carried out on your records to help you confirm that they are suitable for transfer. At this point you are still responsible for them, including responsibility for FOI requests.
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    Once the checks are completed, you will be prompted to confirm that you wish to transfer custody of the records to The National Archives. This is the export stage. We only take custody of your records once you confirm the transfer of custody at the export and final stage of the process.
                </p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">At what point have I transferred the files?</h3>

                Once your records have been uploaded and checked, you will be prompted to confirm that you wish to transfer them to The National Archives. You should keep a copy of your records until we confirm preservation at The National Archives. We will endeavour to complete this within 90 days, however it could take longer. We will also notify you when your records have been released to the public.

            <h3 id="metadata-captured" class="govuk-heading-s">What metadata will be captured in TDR?</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                During the upload process, TDR  captures the following metadata from the consignment:
            </p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>File path</li>
                <li>File name</li>
                <li>Date (usually last modified)</li>
                <li>Type (distinction between folder and file)</li>
                <li>Checksum</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                The format of the file is also identified using <a href="https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/manage-information/preserving-digital-records/droid/">DROID</a> which was developed by The National Archives.
            </p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Why are you asking me to add descriptive metadata?</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                During the upload process, TDR runs DROID to capture basic file-level metadata. However, if you have additional information about your records, you should add this. We strongly recommend that you supply this information to us. It can include anything from descriptions to additional dates and any additional data that will provide context to the record and make it easier to find in the future. To do this during private beta, you will need to download DROID and create a metadata CSV which contains the additional metadata. For further assistance, contact <a href="mailto:tdr@@nationalarchives.gov.uk">
                tdr@@nationalarchives.gov.uk</a>.
            </p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Why do I need to export my records when I have already uploaded them to TDR?</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                TDR is a service that prepares records to be transferred. When you upload your records, you still have legal custody over them and are still responsible for any FOI requests. At the final stage of TDR you will be asked to confirm that you wish to transfer custody of your records to TNA. When confirmed, both the records and legal custody will be exported to TNA. Until you are notified that your records have been successfully transferred and are live on <a href="https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/">
                Discovery</a>, it is important that you keep your records safe and do not delete them or alternatively, keep a copy of your records.
            </p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">
                Do I need to wait for a notification before I can transfer another consignment?
            </h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">No, consignments can be uploaded back to back.</p>


            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">General</h2>
            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Who can I contact if I have a query?</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">Contact <a href="mailto:tdr@@nationalarchives.gov.uk">
                tdr@@nationalarchives.gov.uk</a> if your query is regarding the transfer process, the status of your transfer or to report an error or issue you have encountered. You can also contact us if you have more general queries regarding the suitability of records for transfer, file format or transfer agreement criteria.
            </p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">I have not received an email to notify me that my records are in the archive</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                This process can take up to 90 days. If you do not receive an email after this time, contact <a href="mailto:tdr@@nationalarchives.gov.uk">
                tdr@@nationalarchives.gov.uk</a>.
            </p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Where can I see the history of my consignments?</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                While TDR is in private beta, this is an undeveloped feature. In the future when using TDR, you will be able to check the status and history of your consignments by visiting your dashboard. This will be accessed via the start page.
            </p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">When using TDR, how secure are my records?</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Like all TNA's services, TDR has undergone strict assessments to meet established security and design standards.
